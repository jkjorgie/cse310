# Overview

This is a simple application that allows the user to shorten and store long URLs that are easier for users to read/consume/use. Additionally, it keeps track of the number of uses that a shortened url has. This would be useful for a marketing campaign, for example, where an email blast sends a shortened URL and the marketing team would like to see the click-through rate on the email campaign.

I wrote this application to grow my javascript and front-end web development skills.

# Future Work

- Make the website mobile responsive
- Actually build the webpage using GitHub pages instead of running locally only
- Hook app up to backend to store data instead of leveraging only local storage
